# progress-crad-pdf-generator-in-python
This is a python project which automatically generates progress card/report of each students as pdf in a institution based on input excel file that contain student details and marks in each subjects.
It is similar to **mail merge** option in ms office but my project generates seperate pdf files for each students.
This is fully developed in android mobile phone using pydroid mobile app to run the python code.
